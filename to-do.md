- Need to dial in the electron wrapper.
- Can't get ship close enough to edge to shoot far off enemies. Consider bringing spawn locations in a bit.
- No sound on bullet hit. BORING.
- Background not zooming fast enough. BORING.
- Movement feels stiff due to static movement speed, consider making this dynamic and weighty.
- Consider adding booster graphics and animations for all ships, and also on player.
- What is the story, we need to have an intro scene as well as intermittent scenes with NPCs.
- Do all items have their good usages and do they feel impactful? Consider removing or changing ones that don't.
- Scores, we probs need a server and DB for scores. It'd be cool to do it arcade style where users add their initials or some name and that's like a global list. Maybe show this leaderboard on the home screen.
- Theme song title is random, we should pick one from what we have to be the primary theme song and always use that one.
- Keyboard Navigation for all menus. This will be crucial for controller support.
- Controller support.
- Fullscreen, window, and scaling size support.
- No quest progress tracking while in a level.
- No sound when the player picks up money and items. Thing picking up rings in sonic.
